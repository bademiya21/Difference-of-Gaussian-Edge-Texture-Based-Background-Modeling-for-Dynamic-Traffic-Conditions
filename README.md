# Difference-of-Gaussian-Edge-Texture-Based-Background-Modeling-for-Dynamic-Traffic-Conditions
Note: This is a very old Visual 2005 project which has not been tested to work with later versions of Visual Studio. Use at your own risk.

This repository hosts the codes I developed with my team in Institute for Infocomm Research, ASTAR. This was developed on Visual Studio 2005 and may not work well in current versions of Visual Studio. However, snippets of the code may be useful for background subtraction for video analytics purposes.
